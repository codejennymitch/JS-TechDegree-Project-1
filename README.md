# Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree Project 1

This project is the first requirement of the Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree program at Treehouse.

The project creates a website that generates a random quote and background color each time the user clicks a button. The quote and color change automatically every 20 seconds, otherwise.

The quotes I have chosen include wisdom from Ron Swanson, Michael Scott, Charlie Kelly, and other favorite fictional characters from TV.
